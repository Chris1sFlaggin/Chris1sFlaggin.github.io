# A Delivery Driver's Best Friend

## The Problem

As a delivery driver for several months, I've experienced the daily struggles firsthand. Juggling multiple orders, navigating unfamiliar neighborhoods, and trying to meet tight delivery times can be overwhelming. The existing tools either didn't integrate well or were too complicated to use while on the go.

## My Solution

That's why I created HurryUp! - a web application specifically designed for delivery drivers, by a delivery driver.

## Features

### 3D map
HurryUp! features an interactive 3D map that:

- **Shows your own pizzeria position** : set gps at work location!
- **Shows all delivery locations** with corrispective delivery hours
- **Visualizes elevation changes** to help anticipate challenging delivery areas
- **adjustable 15km nearby range**

### Simple Interface
The app features a clean, driver-friendly interface that's easy to use with just one hand while on the move.

### No registration needed
Just download the app and start using it immediately. Your data is stored temporarily in cookies.

## Future features

### Best trip suggestion

HurryUp! analyzes your current location, pending orders, and traffic conditions to suggest the most efficient delivery sequence. The algorithm prioritizes:

- **Time efficiency** - Minimizing total delivery time
- **Fuel consumption** - Reducing unnecessary mileage
- **Delivery windows** - Ensuring time-sensitive orders arrive on schedule
- **Geographic clustering** - Grouping nearby deliveries for efficiency

This feature helps drivers maximize earnings by completing more deliveries in less time while minimizing stress and fuel costs.
